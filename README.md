# Stack Overflow Analysis - Tidy Tuesday Week 36 (2024-09-03)
Welcome to my project for the Tidy Tuesday challenge (Week 36, 2024), where I explore the Stack Overflow dataset using R. This repository contains the code used to build the visualizations and dashboard. The dashboard is published online via GitHub Pages.


## Ongoing Project
Please note that this is an ongoing project. I am continuously improving the analysis and adding new visualizations or insights as I further develop my data analysis skills. Stay tuned for updates!

## Visualizations Included
The dashboard contains the following visualizations:

- **Distribution of Age Categories**
- **Distribution of Years in Professional Coding**
- **Yearly Compensation Distribution in Top 5 Countries by Respondents**
- **Yearly Compensation Distribution Across Age Groups**
  
## Live Dashboard
